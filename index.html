      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Romanticism is a movement in art and literature that originated in the
        late 18th century. It characterized works of painting, music, and
        architecture. Romanticism was a reaction against Enlightment, 18th
        century rationalism and physical materialism in general. Its attitudes
        consisted of an appreciation of the beauty of nature, emotion over
        reason, senses over intellect, and an examination of human personality.
        This website focuses on the beautiful paintings and creative artists of
        the movement.

      <h2>Influence and Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        Romanticism originated in France and Great Brittain. It was
        <b>influenced</b> by and was a response to the disappointment with
        Enlightment values of reason and order tht originated after the French
        Revolution in 1789. Romanticism was also <b>influenced</b> by the
        industrial revolution, and it was often seen as an artist's way to
        escape modern reality. The movement was sometimes referred to as
        "Counter-Enlightment." It's <b>legacy</b> still lives on in society.
        Romanticism influenced political ideology and it brought focus to the
        poor and the oppressed, as well as generated ideals of social
        emancipation and progress. Just as important, it generated a sense of
        personal commitment to others and to society in general.
